# Welcome to Team Nike Incident Reporter

- During or after an incident either theft or accident, they are always first respondents. These respondents are normally not related to the victims and not the authorities (Police or fire services).

- The problem here is that the families and relevant authorities are the last to hear about the incident.

- Incident reporter using the preamble API plans to breach that gap.
